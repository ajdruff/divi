**Synopsis**

Elegant Themes Legacy Divi theme (version 2.3.4 updated 02-17-2016 ) patched to work with WordPress 4.5


Motivation

Websites using a legacy version of Divi break when updated to WordPress 4.5+ apparently due to an updated version of jquery.

**Installation**

Install like any other WordPress theme using the WordPress admin panel or by unzipping and placing it in the wp-content/themes directory and activate it.

**Security Fix**

This version contains a security fix that corrected a critical privilege escalation security vulnerability that, if properly exploited, could allow unprivileged registered WordPress users to perform a subset of actions within the Divi Builder, including the potential to manipulate posts.
